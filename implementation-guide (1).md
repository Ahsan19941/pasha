# PASHA Benefits Portal - Implementation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the PASHA Benefits Portal implementation using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.

## System Overview

The PASHA Benefits Portal is a web application that allows:

2. **Admin Users** to manage members, partners, offers, and system settings
3. **Partner Users** to verify member status and manage their profiles

## Technology Stack

- **Linux**: Operating system for hosting the application
- **Apache**: Web server with mod_rewrite for clean URLs
- **MySQL**: Database for storing all application data
- **PHP**: Server-side programming language (PHP 7.4+ recommended)
